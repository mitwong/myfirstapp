Learning Android app development via the android.developer.com walkthrough.

This is my first experience with Android and Java so hopefully things will work.

This also gives me a chance to better understand how git works considering it was always too risky to mess with
given that most of my previous projects have been course projects. In the past I've only used git to push commits, and
now I want to learn about the other features such as branching and proper merging.
